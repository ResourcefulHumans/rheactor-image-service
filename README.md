An image processing backend running on AWS Lambda.

Uses [gm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gm) with GraphicsMagick (which is available by default)
on AWS lambda.

It takes JPEG or PNG images that are uploaded base64 encoded, resizes them on the fly to
256x256px size, and stores them on an S3 bucket.

It expects to be called via AWS API Gateway and uses parts of the provided API key as a prefix
for the S3 location.

   Region to use.
 - `MOUNT_URL`  
   Public endpoint for the lamba function (as provided by API Gateway)
 - `WEB_LOCATION`  
   Public URL for the bucket
